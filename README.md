    By Jose Luis Blas Ralde

It is my first Linux project It was created on 2011 for learning purposes 
my goals are (by doing):

* Learn how to linux works
* how to build a distro
* how works pentesting tools
* how to compile/manage kernel linux and modules
* how to compile form source code
* how use package manager
* how to configure network
* how to use scripts
* how to use diferents hypervisors
* how much resources does linux use
* how to use this distro for pentesting purposes
* how to capture/inject network traffic in a computer using qemu and this distro without boot from usb and installing something 
* the difference between linux distros

SUMARY: Is a minimal pentesting distro based in [Damn Small Linux 4.4.10](http://www.damnsmalllinux.org/). I really learned a lot doing this distribution.

## What does it contains?
It contains 283 tools, and some most popular pentesting/hacking tools from 2011!!!

* Metasploit
* Nmap
* Umit
* Etthercap

and many more!!! this the /pentest directory
